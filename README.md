# Career Cluster Application for the York County Regional Chamber of Commerce
## Developed by KJ Vaughn, Gavin Anderson, Ross Friend, Alisia Weaver, & Brandon Hyzy
### TODO: 
###      1. Setup server.js file with Express/Node to handle basic requests & specify the local port which will be used (later on, will be used for future connectivity between MySQL DB and web app)
###      2. Begin implementing basic components (cluster/subcluster/career field/pathway containers)
After the repository has been pulled, launch the application by navigating to the directory using **"npm install"** to install the necessary dependencies. Then use **"npm start"** on the command line to launch the server on localhost:3000.
