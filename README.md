### TODO: 
###      1. Initialize NPM directory with Node & install dependencies 
###      2. Use React commands to create boilerplate React file structure
###      3. Setup server.js file with Express/Node to handle requests & future connectivity between MySQL DB and web app
###      4. Begin implementing basic components (cluster/subcluster/career field/pathway containers)
## After the server has been initialized, launch the application by navigating to the directory and using "npm start" on the command line
